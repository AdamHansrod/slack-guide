# slack-guide
The best damn guide to slack ever. An open source github pages site.

## Joining your slack team
Joining slack is up to you. Membership is open to everyone in the organisation. You just need to visit

    <organisation>.slack.com

and sign in using your <organisation> email address.

### Joining if you don't have a <organistion> email address
If you are not part of <organisation> then you will need to contact the <organisation> slack administrators to get access. You'll get a **restricted account** which doesn't have quite the same privileges as normal users but still allows you to collaborate with members of <organisation>.

## Your Slack Profile
Your Slack profile is very important, as it is the main method people will use to find out who you are and what you do. Please fill in all fields as well as a profile photo of you (not an avatar). This is important as many people will never have met you but you will be interacting closely with them. A real photo can really help. Slack has a guide on how to [edit your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Editing-your-profile).

## Notifications
In Slack you can alert individual users with @username or @channel to notify everyone in the channel (or @here for just those people online). If you belong to a channel that has a lot of members / content (e.g. #general) @channel notifications might be something you don't want to see. Slack allows per channel customisation of this.

## Leaving Slack
When you no longer work for <organisation> your account will be deactivated by the <organisation> slack admin team as part of the normal joiners and leavers process.

## Finding others
Slack's Team Directory (availble from the menu) can be incredibly valuable for finding people in a large, distributed organisation. If you have filled in your profile fully then others will be able to find you. You never know when someone will need to find you!

## Channels
Slack allows for **public** channels which anyone who is a member of the <organisation> slack can find and **private** channels which you need to be invited to join. 
<organisation>'s slack channel strategy can be described as “teams, communities, locations, and events”. By team we mean the small group of people that you work with everyday (not the slack 'team). The channel streategy includes:
* Each team is encouraged to maintain a public channel (if you are the team lead please consider setting this up)
* Each team may create multiple private channels for differnt purposes
* Each community of practice has a public channel (community leads please go ahead and create these)
* Each location has a public channel
* Each event has a short-lived public channel
Slack has a guide on how to create a channel. There are going to be a *lot* of channels. Channels can be really useful for targetted public conversations. To keep channels discovereable your new channel should be named according to the conventions described below.

#### Team channels
Each team may wish to create a public channel, and service teams can maintain a public channel if they wish. This will enable teams to talk with one another about business challenges, technical problems, environmental issues, etc.
A public team channel must be named #team-<name of digital service> for service teams, and #team-<team name> for operations teams.
