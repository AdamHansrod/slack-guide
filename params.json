Membership is open to everyone in the organisation. You just need to visit\r\n\r\n    <organisation>.slack.com\r\n\r\nand sign in using your <organisation> email address.\r\n\r\n### Joining if you don't have a <organistion> email address\r\nIf you are not part of <organisation> then you will need to contact the <organisation> slack administrators to get access. You'll get a *restricted account* which doesn't have quite the same privileges as normal users but still allows you to collaborate with members of <organisation>.\r\n\r\n## Your Slack Profile\r\nYour Slack profile is very important, as it is the main method people will use to find out who you are and what you do. Please fill in all fields as well as a profile photo of you (not an avatar). This is important as many people will never have met you but you will be interacting closely with them. A real photo can really help. Slack has a guide on how to [edit your profile](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Editing-your-profile).\r\n\r\n##\r\n",
